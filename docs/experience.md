  content: At UKWDG, I worked with a range of database and reporting technologies to produce high quality reports based on live, real-time production data. My day to day involved working in a ticket based workflow whereby I would produce reports for non-technical users and answer a range of business related queries. I was also responsible for creating stored procedures to fetch, update and delete data on the back of our in-house, Angular application, Navigator 2. These procedures were time critical and often I would be tasked with rewriting old procedures to improve their efficiency.
