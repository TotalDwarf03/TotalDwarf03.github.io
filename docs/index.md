# Welcome

## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Kieran. I'm an Apprentice Software Engineer working part-time at ONS[^1] alongside study at USW[^2]. On this site, you can find a range of information about me: the tech I use, places I've worked, things I've done and where to get in touch.

## Website Concept

This website is built using the principle of less is more, being simplistic, quick to put together and easy to work on, while still doing a good job. Lots of developers spend hours working on their portfolios, making them unique while adding uneeded complexity. With my portfolio, I've decided to take the opposite approach - How can I get the best result in the simplest and quickest way possible? 

## Where to Go Next

From here, enjoy exploring the site. I'd recommend going in order of the pages using the navigation at the bottom of the page.

Alternatively, feel free to visit some of my other platforms. Links are available using the icons in the bottom right of the page or visit [Get in Touch](./contact.md).
