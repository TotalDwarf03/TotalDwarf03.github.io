						<header>Junior Software Engineer @ ONS</header>
						<div>
							<p>Nov' 2024 - Present | Newport</p>

							<p>
								Working within Digital Innovation to produce, deliver and maintain a range of innovative software solutions. Within this role I:
								<ul>
									<li>Develop and maintain applications using a range of technologies.</li>
									<li>Work with a range of stakeholders to understand requirements and deliver solutions appropriate to their needs.</li>
									<li>Deploy solutions to cloud environments, such as AWS, having an awareness of security and any maintenance required within our architecture.</li>
									<li>Produce well-tested and standardised code using a range of testing and linting utilities.</li>
									<li>Review code of others and provide constructive criticism.</li>
									<li>Work within an agile environment, using Jira and Confluence to manage workloads and document solutions.</li>
									<li>Mentor less experienced developers, such as year in industry students, to help progress their careers.</li>
									<li>Suggest technical improvements to our existing systems, to improve our efficiency and better organise our digital landscape.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<p>
								I work with a range of technologies within this role, such as:
								<ul>
									<li>Python.</li>
									<li>HCL / Terraform.</li>
									<li>HTML, CSS, Javascript.</li>
									<li>Python web frameworks like Flask and Streamlit.</li>
									<li>SQL.</li>
									<li>Docker.</li>
									<li>REST and GraphQL APIs.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<p>
								I gained this position through open and fair competition within the Civil Service, using my previous apprenticeship experience to help me secure the role.
								I am aiming to continue to climb the ranks as a software engineer, and to continue to develop my skills and knowledge within the field.

						<header>Network 75 Software Engineer @ ONS</header>
						<div>
							<p>Feb' 2024 - Nov' 2024 | Newport</p>

							<p>
								Within this role, I worked on a range of projects to help ensure developer standards, best practice and productivity. I gained this position through my degree apprenticeship with Network 75.
								As a Network 75 Software Engineer, I gained a range of experience with regards to commercial software development, such as the importance of accessibility and security within applications, and the importance of testing and documentation.
								In this position, I also managed to gain a range of technical skills and boost my hobbyist knowledge of software development (particularly with Python) to a more professional level.
								I gained a lot of experience with cloud architecture and deployment procedures, as well as the importance of version control and CI/CD pipelines.

						<header>Network 75 Power Bi Developer @ ONS</header>
						<div>
							<p>Dec' 2023 - Feb' 2024 | Newport</p>

							<p>
								As a Power Bi Developer, I worked alongside DST Resource to create a range of Power Bi dashboards to provide greater financial insights within DST.
								The role involved working with non-technical stakeholders to understand their requirements and deliver solutions that met their needs.
								I often had to work with large unstructured datasets, and had to use a range of techniques to clean and transform the data into a usable format.
								Within this position, I also had to introduce development standards (such as version history notes) and upskill other members of the team to help them understand the capabilities of Power Bi and how to use it effectively.
								This would ultimately allow the team to become more self-sufficient, reduce their reliance on external developers and produce and maintain their own dashboards.

						<header>Junior Application Developer @ UKWDG</header>
						<div>
							<p>Sep' 2022 - Oct' 2023 | Taff's Well</p>

							<p>
								During my time at UKWDG, I worked on a range of projects regarding databases and reporting, using technologies such as SQL, SSRS and Power Bi.
								In the role, I experienced a scrum routine, attending daily stand-ups and sprint reviews. 
								I worked on various Help Desk tickets for non-technical users, and was responsible for the maintenance and development of a range of databases and reports.
								This position allowed me to work with large, relational datasets and to understand the importance of data integrity and security.
								I also gain experience around database/report performance tuning, data warehousing techniques, and the development of triggers, stored procedures and functions.
							</p>

							<p>
								Towards the end of my time at UKWDG, I also started to investigate the Angular framework, and began to develop a range of small applications to help me understand the framework and its capabilities.
								This would allow me to become a self-sufficient developer and handle tickets across the full stack.
								In addition to Angular, I also had some exposure to Android Studio and Kotlin, being used within the shop floor's barcoding system.

				<h3>Hardware</h3>
				<h4>PC</h4>

				My PC is a custom build, with the following specs:

				<ul>
					<li>MSI X570S Torepedo Max</li>
					<li>AMD Ryzen 7 5800x</li>
					<li>AMD 6950XT</li>
					<li>32GB DDR4 RAM @ 3000MHz</li>
					<li>Corsair RMx 1000 Shift</li>
					<li>Phanteks P500A</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>HP Laptop</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>HP Pavillion 15-eh0009sa</li>
					<li>AMD Ryzen 4500U</li>
					<li>AMD Radeon Graphics</li>

				</ul>

				<h3>Software</h3>

				<h4>OS</h4>

				<p>
					I daily drive Windows 10 <i>(11 soon?)</i> on both my PC and Laptop, and use MacOS on my MacBook Pro. On my Windows machines, I use Ubuntu WSL2 for development purposes as I prefer Linux's terminal.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the future, I would like to migrate to a Linux distro as my daily driver for my laptop, making use of a virtual machine or portable installation of Windows for any software that requires it.
					I'd probably either move to Ubuntu (for simplicity and ease of installation) or Arch (to challenge myself).
				</p>

				<h4>IDEs</h4>

				<p>
					I primarily use Visual Studio Code for development, with a range of extensions to help me with my workflow. I enjoy VSCode's flexibility to work with a range of languages.
					I would like to explore JetBrains' suite of IDEs in the future, as I have heard good things about their capabilities. Although, I do not plan to move away from VSCode any time soon.
				</p>

				<h4>Other Useful Tools</h4>

				<p>
					Some notable tools I use include:

					<ul>
						<li><b>Yazi</b> - Terminal based file manager for MacOS.</li>
						<li><b>MkDocs</b> - Static site generator from markdown for code documentation.</li>
						<li><b>Draw.io</b> - Useful for any designs or mock-ups.</li>
						<li><b>Amethyst</b> - MacOS tiling window manager.</li>
					</ul>
