# TotalDwarf.Github.io

## Description

A summary page about me, hosted at [TotalDwarf.dev](https://totaldwarf.dev).
The site is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
The Jekyll theme used is available on Github and is called [Hacked Jekyll](https://github.com/piazzai/hacked-jekyll).
It is created by [Piazzai](https://github.com/piazzai).

## Usage

1. Clone the Repo
2. Install Ruby and Bundler (Bundler is normally included with the Ruby installation)
3. Navigate to the Repo in Git Bash
4. Run `bundle install`
5. Run the site locally using:
    ```
        bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```
6. Navigate to http://localhost:4000 to view the site

## Additional Comments
I do plan to add more content to my Github Pages site without the use of Jekyll.
I'd like to add a more detailed portfolio section using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I might even look into a framework such as React or Angular.
