# TotalDwarf.Github.io

## Description

A summary page about me, hosted at [TotalDwarf.dev](https://totaldwarf.dev).
The site is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
The Jekyll theme used is available on Github and is called [Hacked Jekyll](https://github.com/piazzai/hacked-jekyll).
It is created by [Piazzai](https://github.com/piazzai).

I have made some changes to the theme, such as adding a last modified time to the page.

## Usage

1. Clone the Repo
2. Install Ruby and Bundler (Bundler is normally included with the Ruby installation)
3. Navigate to the Repo in Git Bash
4. Run `bundle install`
5. Run the site locally using `bundle exec jekyll serve`
6. Navigate to http://localhost:4000 to view the site
